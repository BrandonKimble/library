# Simple Book Library

One of my first javascript projects! Here, I practiced manipulating the Document Object Model by dynamically adding book objects to the HTML via JavaScript.

## What Does it do?

This is a simple web library with a form to fill out on the right with input fields for a book's title, author, pages read so far, and a checkbox to designate where you've completed the book. Next, hit the "Add Book" button to add this book to the library's display.

### Constraints

For now, books do not remain in the library upon leaving the app. An object store will be implemented in the future via LocalStorage or a more robust/secure storage method. 

### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. For this project, just fork this repository and open the index.html file via a live server.
